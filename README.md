Instructions: 
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

<ul>
    <li>You need to buy before you can sell</li>
    <li>Pay attention to edge cases like when the lowest day is the last day or the highest day is the first day.</li>
